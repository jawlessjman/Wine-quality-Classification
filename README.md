# Wine-quality-Classification

# Abstract
Trying to predict the quality of wine is a challenging task due to the subjective nature of quality assessment and how quality is determined. This project applies several machine learning classification techniques to predict the quality of red wine. These machine learning methods were applied to the UCI Wine Quality dataset particularly the red wine dataset. Among the several evaluated models, the Extra Trees Classifier had the highest overall score over several categories, and with an accuracy of about 0.67%. The relatively low accuracy shows the difficulty in predicting the quality of red wine.
